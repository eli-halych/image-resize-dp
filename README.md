Image resizing using dynamic programming

## What is used
Python, Algebra, Probabilities

## Program-related knowledge

**Dynamic programming (DP)** - a technique for computing **recursive** algorithm with
highly **overlapping** subproblems by only solving each subproblem once.

Ascending by efficiency (descending by complexity): recursion, memoization, bottom-up.

**Content-aware image resizing** - resizing based on the content so that the result
looks natural.

**Seam carving** - removing uninterrupted sequences of pixels when resizing.
